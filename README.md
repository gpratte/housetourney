The goal of this project is to create a web application to allow administration and game day running of a season long poker tournament. Different games will have different rules (amount of buy in, how points are awarded, payouts, length/blinds/antes of rounds, ...). A plugable/extensible architecture is required to support a wide range of business rules.

The development stack will be Java running in Spring.
The persistence will be a PostgreSQL database.
The user interface will be responsive web using Javascript/CSS.

This project is in the inception state and as such the tools agile tools to use will be the first point of business.
